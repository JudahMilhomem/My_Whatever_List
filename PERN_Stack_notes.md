# What I've learned/re-learned so far:
- Client-Server Architecture;
- RESTful API;
- How Back-End and Front-End communication works (where and how data is stored);
- KIND OF got to know how Asynchronous programming works;
- First time using environment variables (got to know why are they important);
- Context API (kind of...);
- Routes;
- Data fetching;
- Got a general idea of how React keeps track of states of things and renders them by using '**_Hooks_**';
- Handling SVG images as React components;
    > p.s. : not really...
- How to update the UI in real time using React hooks;
- When not to use the Context API for rendering a component;
- How to deal with generic components and passing states between "father and son".

# Some React PAIN for Dummies ðŸ’€:
- Learned (the hard way) that components automatically inherit CSS styling from others if they have the same exact className;
- You gotta be careful with how you refactor your React components.
